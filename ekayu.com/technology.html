                        most widely utilized techniques in the food industry. Its
                        main objective is to produce shelf-stable products by
                        reducing the population of microorganisms in trays,
                        containers, or multilayer pouches.

                        Foods are half-cooked and packaged in a container or

                        shelf life can range from 6-18 months. Thermal processing
                        is an effective and efficient method of preserving food,
                        providing meals with extended shelf life.

                            and enzymes through a combination of temperature and

                        to change directly from a solid to a vapour without

                            species. The process involves lowering the product
